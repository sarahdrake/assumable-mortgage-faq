Many listings include a calculator to model the blended rate and payment.\"\n  }, {\n    q: \"Can I put more money down to lower my payment?\",\n    a: \"Extra money does not change the assumed first mortgage’s payoff schedule—it only reduces its outstanding balance.

Weights are based on each loan’s amount.\"\n  }, {\n    q: \"How does using a second mortgage with an assumable mortgage affect monthly payments?\",\n    a: \"Often monthly payments are lower than taking a single new mortgage at today’s rates because the blended rate (weighted between the assumable and second loans) is typically more favorable.
